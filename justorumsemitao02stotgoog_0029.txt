Mr. Wheatley has also found a feast lor the ind of Novem-
ber, of which the huglioan Kalendnr now knows nothing.
He seems to go out of his way to find legende to else ont his
historias, asitha had not prepared tho minds ol his readers
ιο find enough of them in the Kalendas itself. Every such
addition helpe moro completely to confuse the true and labu-
lous stories. And nothing does so more effectually than re·
lating a legend ol a true character, ss ol S. Benedici, instead
of giving the simple particulare of his lile. These legende may
be individually true or false3 and so may the serious histories;
but the former have an air ol improbability upon the iace oi
them, and therefore increase the suspicions and Popist ap·

order to create a presumption at first sight against the whole
history of the saints aud holydays, it is only necessary te relate
an occasional legend, which strengthens the inoredulous in
their disbelief in the narrative, and acts unlavourably on the
minda even of those who are inclined to believe much. And
no one can read Mr. Wheatley’s chapter on the Kalendar
without being painiully convinced that this was his design
throughout. Yet this manner oi narrating these historias
supplies us with an encouraging reflection. 1t those who
