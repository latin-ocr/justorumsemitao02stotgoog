sunt Valentia dit, Vasa me ca,
Et apperte pers 1 choysir.

A similar custom¹ os choosing valentines occurs in
many parts of France‚ among the young people, on
the evening of the first Sunday in Lent.

Ἰ Madame Royale¹, daughter of King Henry IV. of
i France, built a palace at Turin, which she called the
¹ Valentim and gave an annual entertainrnent in it,
when the ladies chose their knights sor the year by
lot, except herself, who claimed the privilege of se-

lecting her own. At every hall during the year each

knight or Valentio presented his lady with a bouquet
Ι of flowers, and each lady or Valentine fiunished the
¹ horse’s trappings of her koight at all tournaments,
Ἴ and the priaes which he obtained became hers.

There is a letter extant³, dated 1476, which seems
to have been a real and not a seigned love-letter, in
ἵ which the lady addresses her lover as her Valentiue.
³ But the whole history of this subject is obscure3 arrd
indeed the custorn is fast descending into the ob·
livien which is the fate of more venerable and useful
r remaius of antiquityss Nevertheleas, as it recals the
³ manners ofa sirnpler and less pedantic age, it must
ever be interesting, even though its continuance can-
not now be defended, when the simplicity which was
ita saleguard, and of which it was the token, has dis·
appeared.
