138 s. stramoniam. [aaron 21. l

Two portione of dressed food were set before each
monk, os which he was to choose one3 and to this
was added another of fruita or vegetables from their
own garden. Their daily allowance of bread was 12
ounces‚ and of wine a hemina, which was probably
equal to three draughts. But abstinence from it was
recommended. The abbat might increase or diminish
the allowance on extraordinary occasions. The flesh
of four-footed anirnals was forbidden, except to the
siclt. At table the monks served each other, and they

cooked their repasts in turn. They entertained κ
guests with great charity and hospitality, lodging Ἰ

them in a separate house, and maintaining them at
the abbat’s expense.

, The habit of the Benedictine monks was regulated

by the abbat according to the climate. In temperate
countries it consisted oi a cowl and a tunic; the Ὗ

cowl, which covered the head, being thicker in win-
ter, and lighter in summer. At work, instead of
the cowl they wore a scapulary, which was at litat
broader and shorter than at present. This was in
earlier tirnes the dress of the peasants and of the poor
generally. Each monk had two tunics and two cowls.
The colour of the Benedictine habit was not pre·
scribed3 but it has usually been black, and hence the
brethren of this order are known by the name of the
Black Monks. ’
Their beds were of quilted straw, witha blanket of
serge,a coverlid and abolster. A lamp bumt all night
in the dortoir, or sleeping-plaoe, and an old monkhad
charge oi the behaviour of the community. They
slept in their habit, not laying asida even their girdle
of leather or serge, that they might n'se more readily 3
