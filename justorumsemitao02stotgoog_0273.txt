The Abbey os Glastonbury was one of the oldest
in England. The ground where it stood was an-

thea, in the year 63 ¹. But it is certain that itis at
least as old as the fifth century, for S. Patrick‚ on
his way from Gaul to his mission in Ireland, found
a society of religious living there, probably undera
rule resembling the Egyptian. K. Arthur, who died
about the year 542, was buried there. Under the
Saxon kings it was liberally endowed, but was plun-
dered hythe Danea in the ninth century, and reduced

to grean poverty. S. Dunstan, as we have seen, re· ,

stored it to more than its former splendour, and
introduced the Benedictine Rule, or perhaps only
revived it. From that time till the dissolutior of
the monasteries in the sixteenth century it was one
of the principal religious houses in the kingdom. Its

superior was a mitred abbat, witha seat in parlia- ἵ

ment, and enjoyed precedence of all other abbats,
till in the year 1154 Pope Adrian IV., who was an

Englishman, gave that distinction to the abbat of χ
