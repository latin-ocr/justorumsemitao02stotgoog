souls, J esu bave mercy!

'l'o them whose pride and glory here
Lies buried in Christ's sepulchre,

To pass from this our sky-arched room
Is but a leaving of the tomb.

lt sensual leanings first shall cesse,
'l'hen to go hence is bnt release.

When alnis and prayers have gone before,
And daily strivings to be poor

Disrobe us of mortality,

And in the heart’s core breed thet sigh
Which pierces heaven, and from above
Brings down the pledged immortal love.

S. Bryanion, the great founder of the ascetis life in
the West, was born in the environs of Nursia a city
of Umbria in Italy, about the year 480. Of his father
Eutropius, and his mother Abundantia, nothing is
known, except that his family was honourable. He
was sent in his youth to study in Rome; but he
soon became alanned by the vice of the young men
his companions, and secretly retired to Sublacum, in
Italian, Subiaco, about forty miles distant, where he
¹ shut himself up in a narrow cave. On his way
thither he met Romnum, a holy monk, whom he
informed of his purpose, and who clothed him in a

monastic habit, and assisted him as he was able.
