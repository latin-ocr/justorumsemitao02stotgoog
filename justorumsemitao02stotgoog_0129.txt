which will ere long dawn upon us-the day of the

as the light of seven dayn, when the Lord bindeth up

their wound¹.’'

, Ere yet the oeiling’o spanglod height

“I am the world’s true Light: who hear,
And follow Me, no darkness leur,

Nor waning evo, nor ohanging year,
Tho light ol Life is theim pure Light ol Life divine !”
