the nights being short, no lassons were read, hutone
frorn the Old Testament was repeated from memory.
On sundays the brethren rose earlier3 and besides
the psalma and many more lessons than on other
days three canticles from the prophets were sung.
The abbat intoned Te Deam after the last response.
On festivals the same order as on sundays was ob·
served‚ only the psalms and lessons proper to the feast
were sung. If any time remained aher the end of
the Vigilav till the beginning of Matina, it was ern·
ployed in learning the Psalter, in reading, or in me·
ditation.

The office of Matios at daybreak was nearly
similar. Christ often resorted to the Temple at
this time, as S. Luke says ¹. It was then that He
was led before Pilate; and that He appeared to S.
Mary Magdalene and the other women after His re·
surrection. After these offiees a certain time was
devoted to mental prayer.

At 9 0’clock the office of Terre was said. At this
bour the Saviour was condemned.

The office of Sext followed at noon, when He hung
on the Rood‚ and when the sun hid bis face at so
shameful a sight.

Noae was sung at first at half-past 1, but in later
agea at 3 0'clock‚ when the Lord yielded up His
spirit, and when He went up visibly into Heaven.

At 6 o’clock Vespere followed. At this hour
the Savionr, on the day before He suffered, instituted
the adorable Sacrament of His Body and Blood3 and

when He was taken down from the cross He was laid
in the tomb of J oseph.
