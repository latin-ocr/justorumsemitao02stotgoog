Tus true history of this glorious martyr is so ob-
scured by tales and false legende that it is now
impossible to know any thing certainly regarding
himo The council of Rome assembled hy Gelasius
in 494 condemned his acts as apocryphal and even
in some parts forged by the heretics to throw dis·
credit upon his name; but included the saint among
the other martyrs of Christ. His name occurs in
one of the martyrologies of S. J erome. And in the
sacramentary of S. Gregory, a proper preface is ap-
pointed for his feast. Itis this: “ It is very worthy,
just, hemming, and salutary that we should always
and everywhere give thanks to Thee Ο Holy Lord‚
Almighty Father‚ Etemal God: through Christ our
Lord‚ for the venerable confession of, Whose name
the blessed martyr Georgo endured divers torments,
and overcoming them was found worthy of the
crown of immortality3 through Whom the angels
laud Thy Majesty‚ the dominions adore, the powers
tremble‚ heaven and the heavenly virtues and the
blessed seraphim in united exultation celebrate3 witti
whom we beseech Thee let our voices also be ad-
mitted, in humble confession saying.’' The martyr·
ology of the venerable Bede commemorates him ou
the 23d April, and concludes in these words, “At
last S. George truly linished his martyrdom‚ by
decapitation‚ although the gests of his passion are
numbered among the apocryphal writings.,”
