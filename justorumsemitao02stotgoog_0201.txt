During three years this charitable monk used daily
to visit the cave where S. Benedict lived, aud carried
to him a portion of his own food. No one else
knew his place of concealment. The cave was near
the top of a very steep rock, and from thetide on
which the monastery of Romanus lay it was inacces-
sible; so he tied the bread which he had brought to
acord, and rang a little bell to let the saint know
that he was come. He afterwards went into Gaul,
and became superior of a monastery near Auxerre,
where he rests.

In his retreat S. Benedict lost all note of time, so
as to be ignorant even of the sesson of the year. On
one occasion on Bastar-day, it was revealed to a holy
priest at a distance, while he was preparing his own
repast, that S. Benedict was faint with hunger, think-
ing that the fastos Lent still lasted. The father
went to him, and told him of the arrival of the joy-
ous feast of the Resurrection, and they took their
refection together. Even in this life of solitude and
heavenly contemplation, the saint was not entirely

free from the assaults of the Evil One. He was l

once so nearly overcome by the remembrauce os a
woman whom he had formerly known in Rome, as
to be on the point os quitting the desert, and return-
ing to her society. But by the might os prayer and
severe austerities the temptet was subdued.

The shepherds in that wild region at first mistook
the saint for a wild beast, all covered as he was with
skins3 but when they came to know who he was,
they held him in the highest veneration; many of
them came to him for instruction, and by degrees lest
off their savage manners.
