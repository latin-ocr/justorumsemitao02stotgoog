less known than many others, and which the western Chumh
has never commemorated. And the merit ol the substitution
of so unexeeptionable a least as that of the Numa os Jeme is
claimed for “ the Reformation,” contrary ιο the truth os his-
tory. Mr. Wheatley dares not to include that venerable name
ἵ iu his catalogue oi Ιίοοιίοι Sotm’ days, and so is constrained
. ιο invent s former commemoration lor this day, and to terget

J one How unfavourably does this example illustrate his
theory l Supposlng his account of it to be true, how are we
ιο explain the place oi thia holyday in the Kalendarl 'l'he
name ol the saint who on his supposition, and in accordance
with his theory, should have been preserved to mark the day

of a little discredit to his theory allow it to be mentioned with
honour, even though on his principles it is useless. Religion
prevailed over logie, and the result we have seen. He does
not solve the difficulty in a later edition os his work by eon·
cluding his account os S. Afra with these words: “How it
came afterwards to be dedicated ιο the Naana osJeavs 1 do not

In the same way Mr. Wheatley pretixes ιο bis account ol
Lammas a history of the festivales S. Peter's chaine, which

eludes by saying that “the Popish people thought the mass ol
this day very beneficial to make their lambs thrive.’' This ia =
