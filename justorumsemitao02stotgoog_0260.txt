of God were themselves exempted from martyrdom,
the saint came out unharmed3 and was banished to
the Isle of Patmos in the Egean sea, where he was
probably condemned to work in the mines. There
he wa's favoured with those visione of the future
which are recorded iu the Apocalypse. The mira-
culous deliverance of the holy Apostle took place
near the Latin gate of Rome, which led towards
Latium.

Thus were partly fulfilled the words of our
Saviour to the brothers S. J ames and S. John, when
they declared that they were able to drink of the
cup which He should drink3 ‘⁶ Ye shall indeed drink
of My cup.” “ Do we ask,’' says S. Jerom, “how
James and John the sons of Zebedee drank of the

chalice of martyrdom, when Scripture relates that
the Apostle James alone was beheaded by Herod,

; but that John finished his life bya natural death?

But if we read in the ecclesiastical history that John
for his martyrdom was cast into a caldron of boiling
oil, and was banished into the island of Patmos, we

shall see that in will he was a martyr, aud that he
indeed drank the chalice of confession3 as did also

, the three children in the fumace of lire, although .

the persecutor did not shed their blood.’'

A church was built by the Christians on the spot
near the Latin gate; and was rebuilt in 7 72. The
feast of this day in honour of it is mentioned in the

Martyrology of S. Jerome, in the Sacramentary of

= S. Gregory‚ and in other ancient Offices. It was

formerly observed in England as a holiday of the
second rank, on which agricultural labour alone was
permitted.
