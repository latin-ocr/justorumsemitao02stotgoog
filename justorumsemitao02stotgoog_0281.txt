to their own choice and likingl Is there any state ³

in the world, any condition, trade, calling, profession,
degree or dignity whatsoever, which is not abused
by some? Are churches exempt from abusesl
Are not Bibles and the word of God ahusedl Is
not Christianity itself abused, and even the meroy
of God ahused? If therefore there is noming so
sacred and divine in the whole world, which wicked
and malicious men do not pervert to their ill designa,
to the high dishonour of God and meir own dmnna
tion, how can any one, upon the mere consideration
of some abuses, pass sentence of condemnation
against a thing, which otherwise is good and holyt
It is an undeniable truth that to embrace a life

exemptas much as can be, from the turmoils of ,

the world, and in a quiet retirement to dedicate
one's sels to the service of God, and spend one’s

days in prayer and contemplation, is a most com· ,

their profession, is their rule and instituu'on to be
condemned; or rather, they who swerve from itt

the fall of J udas3 nor the commandments lie under χ

an aspersion upon the account of those that break

testimony of the modern writers in favour of the
secandary advantages which resulted from the monas·
tic life: such as the services which were rendered tc
