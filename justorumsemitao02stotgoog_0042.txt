ΟΒ THE KALENDAE. XXXV

soth Jannary and seth May. And the common Prayer was

ἒ finally adjusted as it now is. It is remarkable how carefully
η ’ all traces of an almam are removed from the Kalendar,
, how reverentlyths names of the saintsareoxpressed, witha
’ notice of their country or sec. 'l'he title of Martyr,Arch·

hishop, Bishop, Priest, Virgin, confessor, Deacon, or Doctor

¹ is added to each; and to the name of our Ladye tho honourablc

title of the Blessed Virgin is prefixed. Among the clergy who

, smistad atthis revisal were Cosins, bishop of Durham3 San·

derson, bishop of Lincoln3 Pearson and Spsrrow, afterwards
bishops of Chester and Norwioh; and Thorndiks, prebendas-y

1 of westminster.

In 1689 a last ellort was made by tho descendants of the
Puritan party ιο remove from the Kalendar the lesser holy-
days, with many other comesos complaint. A commission
was appointed ιο prepare a list of grievanccs and proposed
adtentione ιο be laid before Convocation This was sanc·
tioned and indeed partly prepared by Tillotson and his friends;
bnt it was so resolutely opposed by Patricls and the high

party, as it may be called, that all intention ol change was
finally abandoned. The proposed alteration regarding the
holydays was thus expressed: “ 'Phat the apocryphal lessons,
and those of tho Old Testament which arctoo natural be

thrown out, and others appointed in their stead hya new
Kalendar, which is already fully settled, and out of which are

omitted all the legendary saints' days and others not directly
referred to in the same hooh.’' Hence we may gathcr that
these saints’ days were not then as now wholly forgotten.
They were one of the grlevances which the Puritans com-
plained οἷς and the Church refused to indulge their humour
hy removing it. What was the general tone ol feeling, regard-
ing the institutione of the Church, among that party, let a
candid observer judge from some of the other proposals. As
for example, “that the chaunting ol the Divino Scrvioe in
Cathedral Chmches shall be laid aside3 that ifany refuso ιο
receive the sacrament of the Lord's Supper kneeling, it may
be administered ιο them in their pews3 that the rubric which
obliges ministers ιο read or hear common prayer publicly or
privately every day be changed to an exhortation ιο the people
