Rome, from the cemetery of Callistus, where they
had been buried‚ into the church of S. Martin.

With S. Fabian is usually joined Sebastian, a citi-
zen of Narbonne in Gaul, bom and educated in
Milan. He served in the army for many years, and
was advanced to a high rank in it by Dioclesian.
Aster converting many to the saith, and encouraging

l others to confess Christ in the face of death, he re-

ceived his crown in the year 288 on the aoth of
January. Dioclesian, discovering that he was a
Christian, condemned him to be shot at by archers,
and he was lest for dead. It is thus that he is gene-
rally represented by painters. Irene a holy widow
going to bury him found him still alive, and took

him home and nursed him. When the emperor
heard of this, he ordered him to be beaten to death

¹ with cluhs. His name is celebrated hy S. Ambrose

and in the early martyrologies, and his feast is kept
throughout the whole Church. His remains were
translated to Soissons in 826, and famed for miracles.
In 1564 his tomh was profaned by the Huguenots.

, His name is horne by oue of the seven churches in

t Rome appointed to be visited by pilgrims. They
are the churches of S. John Lateran the cathedral

church of Rome, of S. Peter in the Vatican‚ of
S. Mary Major, and the Holy Cross of Jerusalem,
within the city; and of S. Lawrence without the
walls, of S. Paul on the Ostian road, and of S. Se-

bastian on the Appian road.

Thus one doth vanquish strong-armed hands,
And o’er his torturers mightier nise,

Till e'en the judge astonished stands
With aue-struck eyes.
