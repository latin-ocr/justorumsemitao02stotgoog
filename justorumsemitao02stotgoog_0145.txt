has been vested in Canterbury. The title of arch-
bishop of S. David’s is said to have been lost when
Sampson, the twenty-fourth or twenty-fiilh bishop in
descent from S. David, was constrained by his clergy
to sail into Brittany to avoid a deadly epidemic
which then afflicted Wales. He carried his pall, the
sign of metropolitan dignity‚ with him, and deposited
it in the church of Dol‚ where it was lest. And
hence the metropolitan title was lost to S. David's.
But if so, the pall must then have belonged topar-
ticular churches, and could not, as in later ages, have
been a personal distinction. For no metropolitan
within the Roman Obedience can now exercise his
authority in a new province without a renewal of the
pall. And the loss of the pall itself could not now
deprive an archbishop of his title or prerogative,
which might be so easily restored hy the grant of
another. Perhaps the poverty of the ree, which
other historiens allege as a reason, is more probable.
The clergy of Dol are said to have claimed exemp-
tion from the jurisdiction of their fonner Metropoli-
tan the archbishop ol Toum, in right of the pall
which had been brought to their church. And this
claim was not finally settled till 1198 by Pope Inno-
cent 111¹.
