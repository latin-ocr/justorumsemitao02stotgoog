“ Although the history of the sufferings of S.
George,” says Tillemont quoting the words of
Usuard, ‘⁶ is placed among the apocryphal writings,
this does not hinder the Chureh of God from honour·
ing this saint among the martyra, and from ever hav-
ing a particular veneration for him, as for one of the
most illustrious.” And, “In the sixth age though
his body lay in the east his power and glory were
famous in the west. Churehes were built in his
honour3 and at this day the name of S. George is
very celebrated among the martyra. Whole nations

. revere him as their patron, delight to take his name,
3 and to give it to their country.''

y The Greek Church has for many ages honoured
S. George with the titles os the Great Martyr, and
of Tropaeophorus, or the Trophy-Bearer, and ob-

serves his festival as a holidsy of obligation when

servile work is forbidden.
Some historians have not serupled to assert that

3 this holy martyr was the same person as George the
ἵ Arian bishop of Alexandria, who was murdered by

the people in 360. This opinion Selden the learned
antiquary thus condemns. “The martyrdome of our
S. George is plaoed under Dioclesian about two

ᾗ hundred and ninety years aster Christ3 that ruge of
ς the people in murdering him of Alexandria, aster

, 86ος So that there intercades seventy yeres betweene
¹ them. Why should we now begin so to confound
into one dress two, who for above thirteen hundred
l yeres time have in both Churehes with all publick
Ι attestation been kept so severall, that as theone was
highly worshipt for a saint and martyr, so the other

l hath bene remembered only as a most wicked here·
