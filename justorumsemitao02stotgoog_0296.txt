of Easter3 their assistance in preaching the word os 1
God to the English ; and that they should administer

authorities state, when Ethelfrid an Anglo-Saxon king
of Northumbria‚ then a Pogon, invaded their country,
and made a dreadful slaughter of monks and clerks.
But the blessed Augustin was then with Christ.
In 604 he consecrated Mellitus to the see ol thc
