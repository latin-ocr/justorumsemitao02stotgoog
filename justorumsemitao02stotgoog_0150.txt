carried into Britain by Agricola-a relation of Seve-

v riarrus a Pelagian bishop in Gaul‚-who was probably
obliged to leave that country when Valentinian llI.

in425 published a severe rescript against the defend·
ers of the heresy. Before long the country was filled

t with it, and at the request os the British Chureh‚ two

learned defenders of the saith carne over from Gaul
in 429 to arrest its progress. These were S. Ger-

³ manus bishop os Auxerre, and Lupus bishop of
¹ Troyes Itis doubted whether Germanus was not

sent into Britain as the legate of Celestine the Bishop
of Rome, or whether the British bishops applied for
assistance immediately to their Gallican brethren ¹.

ἵ They lauded safely aller encountering a violent
¹ storm3 and began without delay to teach the true

saith of Christ in every part of the comrtry. A great
conference was held at S. Alban’s‚ in which the
Pelagians were refuted, and the people testified their

ἶ joy by loud shouts. Their confidence was firrther
l secured by a great victory over the Saxons and Picts,

which was gained while Gennanus and Lupus were
p in the camp.
’ About twenty years afterwards the heresy began

¹ to revive‚ and Germanus returned in the company of

Severus bishop of Treves‚ on the same errand as his
former one. They were welcomed with great honour,
arrd finding the people for the most part orthodox,

’ they persuaded them to banish the leaders of the sect

out of the country3 and thus Britain was once more
delivered from it. The champions of the saith con·

r firmed their doctrines by several wonderful miracles.
