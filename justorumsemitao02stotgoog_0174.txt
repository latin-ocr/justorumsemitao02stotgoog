even declared that whoever should first assert this
undue prerogative over other bishops would be the
forerunner of Antichrist; an opinion to which every
Christian iu communion with the aee of Rome at this
day may yield his hearty assent

Justly as Gregory condemned this assumption of
the patriarch, he elsewhere in his writings declares
the pre-eminence which the see of Rome then held
among other churches. Thus regarding the primate
of Byzacena whom the emperor had sent to him for
judgment‚ he writes, “ As towhat he says of his sub·

» jection to the apostolic see, I know of no bishop who

is not subject to it, if any fault is found in a bishop; ’
but where fault does not demand, all are equal for the

. sake of humility¹.¹' And again, “without the au-

thority aud consent of the apostolic see nothing that
is done iu a Synod has any force ²,” And in another
place he calls the apostolic see “the head of all the
churches³. We shall see by and by how nearly the
language of some doctors of the Anglican church
expresses the same opinion. John the patriarch lived
aud died in the reputation of sanctity, and was other-

wise highly esteemed by the whole Church.

In the same year in which this dispute began a

’. couucil of twenty-three bishops met in Rome to settle
¹ many matters of discipline. They enacted that no
, priest serving at the altar should chaunt even the

Gospel at Mass, lest he should be chosen rather for
the sake of his voice than for his character. Clerks

. of the lesser order were enjoined to sing the Psalms
' aud to read the lessons. The council recommended
’ all bishops to employ clerks aa much as possible in
