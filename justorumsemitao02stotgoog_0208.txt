Complt'n was the last office of the day3 it was
sung at 7 o’clock in the evening3 the same hour at
which He agonized in the guden, and at which He
appeared to His disciples on the evening of His resur·
motion, saying “ Peace be unto you.”

It does not appear that Mass was said on work-
ing days, buton all sundays and festivals.

The rest of the day was spent in work and reading.
ln summer the brethren went out to labour at 6
o'clock‚ and remained till 10, when they returned
to the monastery and employed the time till Sext
in reading. Dinner followed3 after which they
reposed for a little, or passed the time in silent
reading, till Noae. They returned to work aller
Noae till the evening. In winter they began the

day with reading till 8 o'clock‚ and aller Terre they
went out to work till Noae. They then took reposo

¹ or studied. ln Lent the reading lasted till Tereo, and
y they worked till half-past 4in the altemoon. On

’ sundays it occupied the whole day. Those who were

employed in work at a great distance from the mon·
astery said their offices at the appointed honre,
y kneeling where they happened to be.

¹ During Lent they took no sood till the evening.
In the Paschal time-from Easter till Trinity Sunday
-they dined after Sext, and took supper in the

χ evening‚ but always by daylight. From Trinity

Sunday till the l3th September they dined alter

Sext, except on Wednesdays and Fridays, when
j they fasted till aller Noae, unless hindered by hard
work or excessive heat. During the rest of the year
’ they did not dine till after Noae. Abook of in-
struction was read while they took their refection.
