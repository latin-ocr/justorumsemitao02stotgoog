l gold, and finally, in 1370, they were translated, by
Ἴ Richard of Bamard castle‚ into the Galilee or Ladye

chapel of the abbey, which Pudsey had built.
“ There was on the south side, betwixt two pillars,'’

γ, says Davies, ‘⁴ a goodly monument all osblue marble,

the height of a yard from the ground, supported by

Ῑ five pillars, at every corner, one, and under the

midst, one3 and above the said Through of marble
pillars stood a second shrine of S. Cuthbert, wherein
the bones of the holy man S. Bede were enshrined,

Ι being accustomed to be taken down every festival

day, when there was any solemn processioa, and
carried by four monks in time of processior and

¹ divine service: which being ended, they conveyed it

into the Galilee, and set it upon the said tomb again,
having a fair cover os wainscot very curiously gilt,
and appointed to draw up and down over the shrine,

when they pleased to show the asumptuousnes there-

of.” The shrinedisappcared iu the sixteeuth century,

J but the relies of S. Bede escaped the desecratiou
l with which those sacred memorials of the saints in

the southern counties of England were then visited.
They were deoently buried under the tomb.
The feast of Ven. Bede was formerly kept in some

r places in England on the aoth of May, with a com·
’ memoration only iu the office of S. Augustin. ln

other places it was deferred till the following day.
Alcock, bishop oi Ely in the fifteenth century, ap-
pointed it to be observed in his diocess on the l3th
of March. Some congregations of the Benedictine
order have long kept the 29th of October in honour
of him, as part of the Latin Church does atthis day.
