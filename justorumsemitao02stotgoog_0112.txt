that account. They then came to Corinth, where S.
l Paul first knew them, with whom they laboured for

atime at the trade oi tent-making. We next hear
of them at Ephesus3 and when S. Paul wrote his
epistle to the Church in Rome, they hed returned to
the imperial city. Finally‚ when he wrote to S.
Timothy on the eve of his martyrdom, they were
once more at Ephesus. The sacred history is silent
as to the causes of their frequent wanderiugs. They
are believed to have ended their lives in Rome, but
whether by martyrdom or not is unknown. That
they were martyrs in will, if not in deed, S. Paul tes-
tifies in his epistle to the Romans ¹.

Ye saintly choire that round the regal seat,
Through Heaven’s eternol palare, endless throug,
Moy we with voice lor mortnl not unmeet

Join your eternel song.

There, in their purple stole, are martyre seen,

And virgins white who knew no earthly fleme,

Like rosee which with lilies blend between,
The vietim⁵s wreeth to frome.
