LordJesus was born of the Virgin Maryi lt was
contrary to the order of nature. And this Body
Which we make is from the Virgin3 why then do we
ask that the order of nature should be in this Body
of Christ, when the Lord Jesus was born of the
Virgin supernaturallyl This is the very Flesh os
Christ which was crucified‚ which was buried; this
Flesh is truly the Sacrament. This Sacrament which

Christ then, which could of nothing make what was
not, cannot it change those things which are, into
what they were not? For it is not less to givea
new nature to things, than to change the old¹.”
