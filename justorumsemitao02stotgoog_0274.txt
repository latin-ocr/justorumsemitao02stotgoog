The last abbat of Glastonbury, Richard Whhing,
was executed as a unitor, on the hill called the Torr,
hy the orders of K. Henry VIII. because he refused
to surrender his abbey into the hands of the royal
commissionem. “ The learned bishop Godwin‚”
says Collier, “observes that there were but three
abbata who had courage enough to maintain their
conscience, and mn the last extremity3 these were

, the abbata of Colchester, of Reading‚ and Richard

Whin'ng, abbat of Glastonbury. It seems neither
bribery‚ nor terror, nor any other dishonourable
motivas could prevail upon these men. To reach
them therefore another way, the oath of supremacy
was offered thern, and upon their rehrsal‚ they were
condemned for high treason¹.” Two monks suf-
fered with the abbat. The landa and wealth of the
house were immediately seized by the commissionem
and applied to their own purposea. And now no-
thing but a ruin remains to mark the site of the
monastery which once enclosed sixty acres of ground
within its walls. The abbey church was one os the

most glorious in the kingdom, and included six cha-
pels‚ of S. Edgar, oss, Many, of S. Andrew‚ of out
Ladye of Lorett0‚ of the Holy Sepulchre, and of S.

Joseph of Arimathea‚ in honour os whom, and of the
blessed Virgin Mary, the church was dedicated. lt
also possessed a most valuable library, which aston-
ished and delighted the antiquarian Leland on his
visit there, a few years before the dissolution‚ but of
which not a vestige escaped the general wreck.
