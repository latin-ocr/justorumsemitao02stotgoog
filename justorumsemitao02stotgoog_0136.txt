the ancient Lupercalia, the feast of Pon and June
Februata ¹, when the names of a number of young
women were put into an um and drawn by lot by the
young men, each of whom devoted himself to the
person whose name he bad drawn while the feast

character by using the names of certain saints, and by
lixing the feast on S. Valentine’s day. Itis certain,
that in the seventeenth century such a change was
made in his diocese by S. Francis of Sales.

those times each lady made choice of a knight, who
devoted himself to her service for a whole year. One
duty which he frequently bad to perform was to ad-
dress verses to her full of tendemess, which he wrote
as a matter of course, without necessarily feeling all
that ,he expressed. The earliest poetieal valentines
known to exist are those written by Charles duke of
