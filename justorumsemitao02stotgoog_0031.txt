xxiv or 666 nicanora.

'l'hese names 1 take by chanc03 the Kalendar supplies ‘an
6666616666 61 other examplee.

Oi the iom· reasons which Mr. Wheatley gives, the first
can apply only to those holydays which fall within the law
Tenus, and which commonly regulata their days of return.
Very lew ol the lesser holydaye are used lor this purpose.
And the number ol days to which the eecoud reason relers is
also small. So that the third and fourth are really the most
important. But ii the third reason has any weight, where
shall we lind a gulde to the principle os 6616611666 which influ-
enoed tbe hamera oi the present Kalendar in rejecting many
names while they admitted others. Either all the saints to
whom churches were formerly dedicated, and in whose honour ’
wales and iairs were on that account held, ara now in the
Kalendar3 or there must have been an additional macrior
the omission oi some oi them, which this theory does not
account ior. Stow, in his Sinary os Loadoaa says that in the
city ol houden, in the reign ol King Henry IL, lisa-1189,
thero were thirteen great conventuali, aud one hundred and
twenty-six smaller parish ohurches. Among these, there were
lour under the invocation ol S. Buttolph3 four, oi S. 01666;
one, ol S. Chriswpher3 cnaei S. Gabrie13 one, oi S. Magnum
one, os S. Pancrate ; one, oi S. lllildred3 one‚of S. Faustam
one, ol S. Bridget; one, of S. Parnel; and one, oi S. Anthony.
Thac these remained till later timesis proved hythe lact that,
after the great lire in 1666, among the churohes that were
ordered to be rebuilt were S. Olsve'e, S. Buttolph’s, S. Pan·
cras’, S. Magnus’‚ S. Mildred’s, and S. Vedaat’s And in
London atthis day there are charchas dedicated in honour oi
S. Sepulchre, S. Olave, S. Antholin‚ S. Vedaet, S. Magnus,
S. Panem, and S. Mildred. Many other names ol sainte no't
now included in the Kalendar, but in whose honour chorches
have been dedicated, might be found by searohing iu other
cities and towns in England3 bnt this example is sufficient to
show that the Kalendar does not contain all such saints. And
ii one chief reason ior retaining the holydays in it was that
chnrches had been dedicated in honour oi them, why were

these omitted l For many ol these are at least quite as oele·
brated aa some that are now in the Kalendar.
