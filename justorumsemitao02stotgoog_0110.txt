naturally to lapse into it. In the Anglican Church

during the last century the greatest advocates of this

heresy were Whiston, and Dr. Samuel Clarke3 and

in Ireland Clayton bishop of Cork and Ross, aster-
wards of Clogher.

The Church at this day seems to have less to fear

from open heresythanfrom the subde, undennining in·

fluence of schism and internal divisions3 though these

are never wholly separable from heretical teaching.

t But sad as is the view which a churchman must take

f of the present course of events, and of the coldness and

artarchy which too much prevail among those who

name the holy name of Christ, he yet draws much

encouragement from considering the progress of

heresy and division in past time. The Church

founded on the etcmal rock of S. Peter’s confession

has till this hour withstood all the attacks of the

powers of hell, and will in the end prevail over them
all, as it has done in times of old3 for the word of
its Lord is “without variableness or shadow of turn-
ing‚” and He has promised that the “gates of hell
shall not prevail against it.’' Heresies will disappear
when He pleases, schisms will be united, and the
novelties of a day will vanish, as they arose, like
adream. And if we are tempted to moum that we
may not live to see such a vision of peace and holy
joy as a reunited Church would be, let us think of
Athanasius and Basil, and many other fathers who
slept in the Lord before He returned to visit His
people. Such a vision, in real and unchanging beauty‚
they and we shall one day see, if we be found worthy‚ y
in the J erusalem above. ’
