the pagan temples, but to purify them with hallowed
water, and to bear the sacred relics into them, and
allemands to use them as Christian churches. This
he directed, in order that the people might be gra-
dually brought to the true saith, by seeiug the places
oi religious association employed in the Divine wor-
ship. On the anniversary of the dedication of a
church or of the birthday of the holy martyr whose

, relies it contained, Gregory enjoined the people to

creet booths around the building, and encouraged
them to celebrate the solemnity with religious festi·

S. Augustin having drus prosperously began his
mission, consecrated the cathedral church of Can-
terbury‚ and dedicated it to the holy Saviour. Its ·
name was afterwards changed to Christ Chnreh. He
also built a church and monastery to the eastward, in
honour os the blesscd apostles Peter and Paul, but

' did not live to consecrate it. lt was afterwards

named, in honour of its blessed founder, the Abbey of

η S. Augustin· Within its enclosure he proposed that

the bodies of the archbishops of his see, and of the
lrings ol Kent, should be laid. Peter was chosen first
abbat, but was drowned not long alter in crossing
over to F rance, and was buried at Boulogne. Itis
now uncertain whether the rule of S. Benedict was

, observed by the monks of S. Augustin, but it seerns

probable when we consider the great veneration in
which S. Gregory held it, and the active part which

ἱ he took in the affairs of the English mission. In later
ages the superior ol this house was a mitred abbat,

and had a seat in parliament. Ita site is still marked
by a ruined gata-house, and other buildings.
