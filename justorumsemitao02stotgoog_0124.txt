, feast Prudentius also has preserved the history οἲ
3 his unexampled sufferings. He is one of the few
early martyre whose Acts are quite anthentic. They
may be trooed to a contemporaneous nge.

0 pninlul lesson, written in 'lhy blood l

To follow Theo l 0 lusson full of pain l
And yet not pninful if it is most good,

The puin shnll poss away, the good remain.

Seek we solt beds to sleep on or to die l
With iron nails upon Thy torturing bed,

'l'hy mked limbs were viewed in ogony 3
And moolery stood by Thy dying head.

Still ns I goze on Theo my tesrs will swell,
The things ol which I glory drup away,

Nothing but ol my sorrows would I tell,
So many ore my sins, so short my day.
