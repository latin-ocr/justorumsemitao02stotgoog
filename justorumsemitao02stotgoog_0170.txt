quarter of the city from which it came. This is
supposed to have been the origin of the “Greater
hitanies” on S. Mark's Day. While the procession
lasted eighty persons in it died of the plague3 yet
Gregory persevered, and the prayers of the city were
heard.

At that time the consent of the emperor was ne-
cessary to confirm the electionof the llishop of Rome.
For besides his high ecclesiastical authority he en-
joyed a delegated power over the senate aud people
of Rome. Gregory wrote privately to the emperor
Mauritius, who had succeeded Tiberius in 386, be-
seeching him to refuae his consent to the choice of the
clergy. When he heard that it had been already
given, and that the gates of the city were guarded to
prevent his escape, he prevailed on some merchants to
oonvey him secretly out of Rome into the country,
where he lay concealed for several days. He was
discovered hy Divine assistance, as historians relate,
and was brought back to the city and consecrated on
the l3th September 590. ln his letters he laments
being dragged from the repose of his convent into the
dangerous activity of a life in the world.

Early in the following year he wrote in council a
synodal letter, according to custom, to the patriarchs
of Antioch, Jerusalem, Alexandria, and Constanti-
nople, professing his saith, and commending himself to
their prayers. ln it he bears the following remark-
able testimony to the authority of the general councils :
‘⁶ Moreover since with the beart man believeth unto
Γ justice, but with the mouth confession is made unto
salvation, Ι confess that Ι receive and venerate the
four councils, as the four books of the Holy Gospel.
