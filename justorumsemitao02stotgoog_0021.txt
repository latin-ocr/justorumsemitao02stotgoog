fast, ιο remind us that those saints who are now comforted
with the vision ol God were once blessed mourners3 and that
it is only through mortification and affiiction that we shall
pass like them into glory and joy, according ιο the Scriptum,
Heavincss may cndure ior a night, but joy cometh in tha
morning. Therelore the festival oi S. Michael and all
Angels has no vigil, because those blessed spirits were never
like us compassed with infirmity. Sometimes the season of
the year is too joyous ιο allow oi fasting, and the holydays
which occur during it have not a vigil. As formerly in the
Pacolol time, irom Easter till the eve ol 'Pr-inity Sunday,
which generally falls between the beginning ol April and the
middle cf June, and from Christmas-day till the end of the

iulness and a part ol that public honour which we owe ιο God =

lor admirable benefits, whereol it doth not suffice that we
keep a secret kalendar, taking thereby our private occasions,
as we list ourselves‚ to think how much God hath done ior all
men, but the days which are choseu out to serve as public

memoriale ol such His mercies ought to be clothed with those Ἴ

outward robes of holiness whercby their differeuce iram other
days may bo made sensible ...... ‘This is the day which
the Lord hath made,’ saith the prophet David, ‘let us rejoice
and be glad in it’ Sc that generally offices and duties oi
religions joy are that wherein the hallowing ol festival time
