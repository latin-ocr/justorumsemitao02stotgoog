ln 1023 King Canute was prevailed ¹on by his
pious Queen Emma to make amends for the cruelty
and sacrilege which his father had committed. He
removed the holy body of S. Alphege to Canterbury
where it was laid in a noble tomb, and the Cathedral
church was enriched by many costly gists of the king
and queen. His relics were long preserved there till
the dispersion of those memorials in later ages.

lanfranc, asterwards archbishop of Canterbury,
was iu doubt whether S. Alphege might be considered
a true martyr, as he died in defence of no part of the
Christian Faith. He consulted S. Anselm, who
replied that he was indeed amartyr, for he had given
his life for the sake of justice, and his sanctity had
been attested by the evidence of miracles. The his·
tory of his life was written in 1070 by Osbern, a
monk of Canterbury.

Our Lord the path of suffering trod.
And since His sacred blood bath flow’d,
’ra meet that man should yield to God
Tho life he owed.

No shame to own the Crucified,
Nay 'tis our immortality
’ 'l'hat we confess our God who died,
And for Him die.

Fill'd with this thought with patient smila
Threatening and death he doth withsand,
Fights, Lord, Thy cause, and leant the while
Upon thy haud.

Seeing above the golden crdwn,
Into death's aruns he williug goes ;

Dying he conquers death ; o’erthrown,
O'erthrows his loeo.

Hymu from Parisino Breviary, p. 281.
