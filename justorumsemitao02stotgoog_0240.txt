garters enamelled, with roses and rnottoes; united

The annual feast of the order begins on the eve
of S. George and lasts for three days ¹.

The chapel of S. George at Windsor, which is also
the chcpel of the order, was begun in the reign of
K. Edward IV. and was not finished till 1516 under
K. Henry VIII. On the same site there was for·
merlya chapel dedicated in honour of S. Edward the
Confessor‚ in which K. Henry 1. placed eight secuIar
priests. K. Edward 11. appointed to it thirteen
chaplains and four clerks. And in 1352 K. Edwerd
111. made ita collegiate church for a dean, twelve
canons, thirteen minor canohs and other assistants¹.

With the name of S. George is associated the me-
mory of all that is glorious in the martial anne-Is of
otu country, when the war-cry of ᾗ. It‘itnrsst fot·
eupiunt, was the signal of victory on the fields of
Crecy andos Agincourt. And in earlier times, when
ue flower of British knighthood led their armies to
the rescue of the holy Sepulchre of the Redeemer,
the name of S. Georgo was their unfeiling watch-
word. His cross is emblazoned on our Union-flag

et this day, surmounted by that of S. Andrew for

¹ Ashmole.
