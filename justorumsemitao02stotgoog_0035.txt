'l'his principle enables us also ιο understand the hatred
with which foreign reformers, Puritans, and Presbyterians
have always regarded these holydays; and which, so lately as
the Revolution, urged them to make a last unsuccessful at·
tempt tc have them removed. 011 the former theory it seems
wholly groundless, or the fruit of insane prejudice. For what
offense could they find in them, if only retained for the aecidar
reasons I have enumeratedl But ιο their uncatholic and
sectarian temper, we may easily understand how distasteful
must have been the memorias of those saintly persons.

Not to dwell too long on this part of our course, let us truce
the history of the Kalendar- from the time when it was held in
highest honour, and the observance of its holydays was a
willing service, downwards through ages of irreverence and
change. More grateful labour would it be ιο follow it from
the early years of British faith, as it was increased, century
after century, by new examples of British and Catholic holi-
ness. But as our theme is the modern Kalendar‚ the former
course must for the present be adopted.

We read that “in 1332 Mepham Archbishop of Cautes-bury
held a provincial councii ct Magfield‚ in which a rubric of the
principal holydays was sanctioned and appointed, together
with the manner how they ought ιο be observed. It conmins
the catalogue cf the chief festivals: Nativity of our Savionr
(then the year began), S. Stephen, S. John, innocents, S. rho-
mes of Canterbury, Circumcision, Epiphany, Purificction of
Blessed Virgin Mary, S. Matthias, Annunciation of Blessed

Virgin Mary, Easter with three following days, S. Maris, ’

SS. Philip and dames, Invention of Holy Cross, Ascension
