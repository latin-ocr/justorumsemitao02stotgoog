Church ol God, when it most flourished in real and
piety,'' says Hooker‚ “ to mark that age with the
brand of error and superstition only because they
had this ceremony more in use than we now think
needful, boldly to affirm that this their practice grew
so soon through a fearful malediction of God upon
the ceremony of the Cross, as if we knew that His
purpose vves thereby to make it manifest in all rnen’s

eyes how execrable those things are in His sight ,

which have proceeded from human invention, is as
we take ita censure of greater zeal than know·

The thirtieth Canon of the English Church‚ which
is especially quoted in the Rubrio at the end of the
office for baptism in the Common-prayer Book, has
these words, “ The honour and dignity of the name
of the Cross begata reverend estimation even in the
Apostles’ time, for aught that is known to the con·
trary, of the sign of the Cross, which the Christiana
shortly aller used in all their actions3 thereby mak-
ing an outward show and profession, evento the
astonishment of the Jews, that they were not asharned
to acknowledge Him sor their Lord and Saviour,
Who died for thern upon the Cross. And this sign
they did not only use themselves witha kind of
glory, when they met with any Jews, but signed

therewith their children when they were chnstened, ἵ

to dedicate them by that badge to His service,
Whose benefits bestowed upon them in baptism the
name of the Cross did represent. And this use of
the sign of the Cross in baptism was held in the

primitive Church, as well by the Greeks as the
¹EectPol.B.v.e.1xv.1l.
