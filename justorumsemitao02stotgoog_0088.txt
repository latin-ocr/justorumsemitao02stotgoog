to be confounded with the saint of that name at
Athens, who is usually called the Areopagite. The
Bishop of Paris is commemorated in the Anglican
kalendar on the 9th of October. When he and his
companions arrived in Gaul, he fixed his abode
at Paris; S. Quintin proceeded to Amiens, and

¹ S. Lucian to Beauvais‚ with two friends, Maximian

and Julian. They devoted themselves with un-

, wearied ardour to preaching and baptizing, in the

face of danger and death; and in the persecution
which raged under Julian, the prefect of Gaul, the

η two companions of the saint sealed their testimony
, with their blood. Lucian, inalittle while aster, fol-

lowed their glorious example, about the year 290.
They suffered in different places, but their remains

¹ were laid by their faithful disciples in the same tomb.

It remained long concealed, till S. Evroul abbat of a

¹ monastery near Amisus, in the end of the sixth cen-

tury, was directed by a vision where to find it. A
stately abbey was founded in the eighth century at
Beauvais‚ in which the precious relics of the martyre
were deposited in three sumptuous shrines. They
were renowned for miracles in the following age, as
Rabanus Maurus testifies.

In most kalendam, as in the Anglican, S. Lucian is
mentioned only as a priest‚ butan ancient one of the

l ninth age styles him bishop. He is called the Apostle
l of Beauvais in the Parisian Breviary.

Faint not, audiret not, for threatened woe,
Watchman on Truth's grey height l

Few though the faithful, and fier-ce though the foe,
Weakness is oye Hesven’s might.
