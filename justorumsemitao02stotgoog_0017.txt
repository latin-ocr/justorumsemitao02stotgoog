X 01³ THE KALENDAE.

Menologies in the Esstern, were historice of the prinoipsl
seinte, which were generally read by the clergy and the mo·
nastic orders to excite their devotion and imitation. From
being thus publicly read, many oi those historice were called
Legendo; end the name was gradually applied to any story oi
a saint, whether authentic or not. 'Phe earliest English mar-
tyrology was written by Ven. Bede in the eighth century, and
contains very short notices ol the saints of that age. Itis
rathere Kelendar than a Martyrology. The Roman mar·
tyrology was adopted in Englend in 747.

In every rational Kalendar ere found nearly the same names
ol our Divine Lord‚ His Blessed Mother‚ and His Apostles ; as
well as of meny others who were eminent in the following ages
for wisdom and sanctity. Τὴε degree ol honour which is pald
to these varies in almost every Chureh‚ according to their con·
nexion with its history. There are slso in every Kalendar
the names of rational end local saints, whose lame has not
spread fruther than their own Church. 'ihus virtues and
seli-devotion unsurpassed in a heroic age, are often remem-
bered only in the bosom ol the lamily or little circle ol friends
who were fsvoured to witness them. Not the less precious
are they, and worthy of imitation, but their praise is of God,
and no't ot' man. And surely to the heart which ieels the
beauty oi secret holiness, nothing can be more touohing than
to know oi saints of whom little is recorded but their names,
hardly even the date ol their departure. Dwelling many eges
ago, in obscurity in deserts and remote islands, they gave to
those around them so clear a reflection of the image oi Christ,
that for His sake they yet live in remembrance. How pure

, must have been their saith, how fragrant their deeds of

charity, which without other aid heve thus embalmed their
memorien. And so far from rendering their existence doubt·
iul, the uncertain record oi their names which is all thet
remains, is good evidence of perhaps a liielong struggle with
the lusts of the ilesh, or ol some work oi love done to Christ
or His poor brethren, which has not been without its reward.
Like thet hlessed woman who anointed the Lord ior His
hurlal, and whose devotion is toldlor a memorial of her,
wherever the Gospel is preaohed; and yet about whom
