tanist. Her name is celebrated by S. Augustin‚

On champions blest, in Jesus’ name,
Short be your atrise, your triumph full,
Till every beart have caught your flame,
And lightened ol the world’s misrule

Gathered long since at J esus’ feet,
No world of passione to destroy,
Your prayer-s and struggles (fer, your task all praise and joy.
