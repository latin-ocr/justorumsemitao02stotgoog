a time, it was personned on the eighth day aster his
baptism, upon the tth December 374. The press-
ing need ol‘ the Church hm always been considered
to excuse the uncanonical irregularity of such pro-
ceedings3 ,and all the bishops of the East and West
approved.

His first act was to give all his goods to the poor.
His lands he bestowed on the Church‚ reserving the
rents lor his sister Marcelline during her lifetime.
His brother Satyrus was entrusted with the manage·
ment of them. He applied himself to the deep study
of holy Scripture and of the ecclesiastical writers,
particularly of Origen and Basil. His instructor
was Simplicianus‚a devout priest who succeeded him
in the see, and was alterwards canonized. He set
himself severe rules of living3 spending nights in
watohing‚ and fasting on all days except sabbath and

’ the Lord's day. In the Church of Milan, as in the
¹ Greek Church‚ sabbath was never observed as a
’ fast-day, even in Lent. But when Ambrose went to

Rome, and other places where such an exemption
was unknown, he always conformed to the local cus-

’ tom. He offered the Christian sacrifice daily. His

chamber was ever open to all who wished to see and

, speak with him. The hospitality which has always .

been considered a chief virtue in a catholic bishop
he largely exercised. But he never was seen at
entertainments in the houses of others. As was the

general custom in the Church of that age he wrote to
the other bishops‚ announcing his election. Among
other letters which he received in answer was one
from S. Basil bishop of casarea, exhorting him to
finnness against the Arians.
