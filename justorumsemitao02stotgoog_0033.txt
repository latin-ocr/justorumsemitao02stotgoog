formerly itself a celebrated holyday in the Churcb of England,
viz. the feast of S. Ethelred ¹.” Do any of the usual reasons
for accounting for the lesser bolydays explain tbe omission of
the vigil of so eminent a saint as the holy Evangelist Luhe,
because it falls on one of theml If the lesser holydays are
wholly secular, as Mr. Wbeatley labours to prove, surely one
of them would not have been allowed ιο interfere with the due
observante of a principal festival, which is altogether religione.
This is a difficulty; and Mr. Wheatley thus explains it: “But
that reason being now removed, I suppose every one is left to
his own liberty as ιο bis private devotione, whether he will
observo tbe eve ae a vigil or not.” 'Phe question is, not what
any one may do in his private devotione, but what rule is laid
down by the fremere of the Kalendar ιο regulata tbe practice
of the English Church. Can any one doubt, that if they had
intended a vigil to be kept on the eve of S. Luke, they would
have ordered it, as was done in the Prayer-Book of Κίος
Edward, where the only feasts which were appointed without
a vigil-fast were those of S. John Evangelist, and of SS. Philip
and damesl And since they have not dona so, does it not
follow that they mnsidered the former “ reason not removed l”
This consideration is much supported by observing that the
system oi vigile is very different in the present English Ka·
lendur from wbat it was in the ancient. In the Kalendar of
Sarum, the only festivals which had vigile were those of
S. John Baptist, S. dames, S. Bartholomew, S. Matthew, All
Saints, S. Andrew, S. Thomas, and the Nativity. These all
fall between Whitsuntide and Christmas3 from Christmas ιο
Whitsuntide there were no vigila. moderatore when the
framers of tbe present Kalendar so far departsd from former
usage as to add several vigils which were notin it before, it is
not to be supposed that they acted without consideration when
they left the feast of S. Luhe as before without its vigil. The
reason for its ancient want of it is allowed by Mr. Whestley3
and he neither maintains that the Church bas since appointed
one, nor has he shown any new reason for its absence; is it
possible to avoid the conclusion that the ancient reason is not
removedl
