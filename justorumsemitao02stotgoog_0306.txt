1534 we find the prospect of a new edition by Luther
so favourably received by the Catholics, that he said
on one occasion, ‘Our adversaries read the Bible

translated more than our own people. Ι believe
that Duke George has read it with more care than

i all the nobility that hold to our side.'”

On the Tuesday before Ascension-day Venerable
Bede became worse, yet he continued to teach his

, disciples, and urged them to diligence, as the time

of his departure was near. He passed the whole of
that night in prayer and praise. Very early next

³.- morning he resumed his instructions till the hour of

terce, or nine 0’clock‚ when the Litanies of Rogation
were sung, and the holy relies were borne in solemn

ἐ processionattendedby the whole convent. One of the

brethren remained with him to write what he should
dictate. About the hour of none, or three o’cloclr,

: he said to Cuthhert‚ “I have a few trilles in a box3
κ pepper‚ incense, and oraria¹,· run and fetch thern,
¹ and call the brethren of the monastery, that Ι may
, distribute these among them.'’ When they were
¹ come, he gave each of thema little memorial of his

love, and besought them all to be mindful of his

., soul in their prayers, and especially when they offered

the adorable Sacrifice. The brethren wept abun-
dantly, but he comforted them and said, “ The time
of my freedom is at hand. I long to be dissolved
and to be with Christ, for my soul desires to see
Christ my King in His glory.” At the Vespers of
that day, as he was singing the antiphon, ORea

¹ Handlrerchiefs, or perhaps stoles, or, as some say, rosarias,

which were first called Bedes from the name ol this holy
lether, as they suppose.
