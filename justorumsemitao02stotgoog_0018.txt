was.

, 'l'he Anglioan Kalendar bas shared the fortones ol the
English Churoh. lt was once much larges and more catholic
than itis now; and was a more perfect summary ofthe
sacred offices. Many holydays which are now omitted, or
barely mentioned, hed formerly special services3 as the
'lh-ansfigontion of our Lord, S. Mary Magdalene, S. Clement,

ἱ “whose nameisin the Book ofLife,'’ and many others. ltis
not for me ιο say. whether such a change has improved tt3
rather am 1 anxious to commend to the faithful what is left,
lest they lose all.

Among the holydays which it now contains, ‘⁶ some are
higher days than others, in regard of the greatness of the
blessing commemorsted, and of the solemnity of the service

y appointed to them ¹.” rl'hese are the principal festivals of the

year,for which there are special offices, more or less varied ,

according ιο the degree of honour that belongs ιο them.
l'hey are generally marked in red letters, or sometimes in old·
English character. The end which the Ghuroh has in view
’ in commemorating these greater holydays is thus taught us
by biehop Sparrow, quoting from Hooker: ‘⁴ As the Jews
had their Sabbath, which did continually bring to mind tho
former world finished by creation; so the Christian Choreb
hath her Lord's days or Sundays, to heep us in perpetual
remembranoe of a far better world begon by Him who came
ιο restore all things, to make heaven and earth new. The
rest of the days and times which we celebrate have relation
all unto our head, Christ. We begin therefore our ecclesias·
tical year (as to some accounts, though not as to the order
of our service) with the glorious Armmciation of His Birth,
by angelioul message. Hereunto aro added His blessed Na·
tivity itself‚ the mystery of His legal circumcision, the testi·
fication of His true Incarnation by the Purifioation of His

blessed mother the Virgin Mary3 His glorioue Resurrection,
and Ascension into heaven, the admirable sending down of

His Spirit upon His chosen, and the notice of that incompre-
hensible Trinity thereby given to the Church of God.
