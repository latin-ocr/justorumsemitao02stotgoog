op rna haundula. XXV

In the Otrooohyy os flietorp, pp. lot-llo, there is re·
printed from another work ou the same subject, a British
Kalendar, compiled from the missale of Sarum, York‚ Durham,
and S. Panl's in London. The οοείειιοοο of those of Hereford,
Bangor, and Lincoln is wanting, and yet almost any one
month conans the names of aa many saints aa the whole of
the modern Kalendar. Among these surely there must he
some that were in ancient days esteemed “favourite minw’
by the people.

Against the fourth maron the presumption is still stronger.
For besides the numerous saints who are not now found in the

’ Kalendar‚ and who asie well known gave their names to dates,

there are many Sundays and great festivals which are known
in chronology by the first words of the introit. 'Phua Au To
oeae is a name frequently given to the first Snndny in Ad·

of these, occupying fifteen peges closely printed in double

¹ columnate given in the Chronolopy oinrtory‚· and a chrono-
’ logical Kalendar which should want such a list, though it

should oontain the names of all the saints, would, as every
antiquarian knows, be nearly useless. Among such days, the
principle of κὰοιίοπ is wholly inadmissible, if there is any
nuth in this fourth reason. For if any day under whatever
name has been referred to as marhing a date in history, it
must he recorded in a Kalendar which professes to be a guide
to such dates. And to be of any use at all for the purpose, it
must contain every such day. Supposing there were formerly
two hundred days referred to by particular names in ancient
historice and deeds, and that fifty of them now mmain in the
Kalendu, is it a srrfficient explanation of the presence of these
fifty ιο say that they were intended ιο fix the date of the
hansactions which happened upon them l Unlesa some more
important claim can be alleged in their favour, no one can for·
bear to ask why are not the other one hundred andflfty also in
the Kalendart for they were not less the names of important
