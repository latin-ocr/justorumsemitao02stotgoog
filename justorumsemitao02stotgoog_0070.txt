ἵ who comest out of the mouth of the Most High,

reaching from one end to another mightily, and
sweetly ordering all things, come and teach us the
way of understanding ¹.”

It was customary in monesteries to hold an an-
nual festival on one of those days on which the

, Greater Antiphone were sung, which was shortly

called the “03” antedating‚ asit were, the joy of
Christrnas. This. practice may still be traced in

modern English collegas. Davies of Kidwelly² says,
‘⁶ Within the Commota Haase did the master thereof

r (who was an official of the convent) keep his 0 Sa.

pientia once in the year; viz. between Martimnas
and Christmas; a solemn banquet‚ that the prior and
convent did use at that time of the year only3 con-
* sisting of figs and raisins, with ale and cakes; and
χ thereof no superfluity or excess, but a scholastical

and moderate congratulation among themselves'’

In the old statutas of the cathedral church of S.
Paul in London‚ in the time of Ralph de Diceto the
Dean³‚ there is a chapter, De faciendo “ 0.” “ Also
the new residentiary must sing his ‘⁴ O. ’¹ against the
l Nativity‚ and aller complin he shall invite the whole
choir to his house ⁴.’¹
