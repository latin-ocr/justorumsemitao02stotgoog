ln lnaak Walton’s Life os George Herbert there
isa description os a religious community‚ which ’

Nicholas Ferrar established in his house at Little
Gidding in Huntingtonshire about the year 1630.
lt was overwhelmed in the storms of the Great
Rebellion. A fuller account ol' it may he sound in
Peokard’s Life of Ferrar.

A sad duty is it to be constrained as it were to
plead the cause of an institution which one might
have thought needed only to be named, to ensure
the affectionate regard of English Christiana. But
such a duty is unavoidable in ages of religiour inno-
vation‚ and is osten necessary in defence of the very
holiest mysteries of the faith. ln few words then let

κ me answer the objections which are made to the
monastic life from the irregular behaviour of some
who have professed it. “ Is in these retirements‚’' says
adevout author, “where every thing is so ordered as
to be most advantageous for the promoting of virtue
and devotion, and nothing be permitted that is likely
to prove a disturbanoe to godliness, or allurement to
evil, yet if some-for God be praised, it is far from
being the case of the generality-live scandalously,
and give ill example to the world, what can be said,
but that no state can secure any man; and that ιιο
such provision can he made in order to a holy life,

, but may be abusedl But yet it is surely not to be
thought that such abuses, and the viciousness of
some, can be argument enough to any just and rea-
sonable man, to condemn the whole, and the institu-
ti‘on itsell. Ia not marriage ahused an infinite num· ι
her of ways, and many forced to embrace that state,
at least to accept of such particular persons contrary
