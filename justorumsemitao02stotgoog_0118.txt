name. Honorius, Bishop of Rome, about the year
630, built, or perhaps only rebuilt, the church where

her body was preserved, on the Nomentan way, three
ἵ miles frorn the city. It is now, as Tillemont men·
ἱ tions, served byCanons Regular. This church gives

title to a cardinal, and every year on the feast of S.
χ Agnes the abbatos St. Peter's od vincalo blesses in
it at high mass two lamhs‚ which are thence carried
to the Pope, who again blesses thern. Alter this they
are sent to the nuns of S. Laurence in Panisperna, or
r sometimes to the Capucinesses, who make of their
wool palliums‚ which the Pope blesses‚ and sends to
patriarchs, primates, and metropolitam, as an ern·
blem of the virtues which should distinguish them,
and as a markos their dignity. The pallium isa
narrow strip of wool which goes round the shoulders,
like the collar of an order of knighthood, and from
which depend four other strips of the same breadth‚
one before and one behind, and one on either
side. There are four purple crosses worked in it,
and three golden needles to fasten it to the vestrnents.
Its figure is still retained in the armorial bearings of
the see of Canterbury. Cardinal Pole was the last
archbishop of that see who received it from Rome.
lt is worn only in church, and on solemn occa-
sions. In the Greek Church it is of a different form,
and is worn by bishops, though in the Latin it has
always been the badge of a'rchbishops, with one or
two exceptions.

S. Agnes has been mentioned with great honour
by many of the Christian writers and saints of the
early ages. S. Martin‚ Bishop of Tours in the end
of the same century, assured his disciple Sulpicius
