Ami angela while they know not round them dwell‚
Whence in their prmum seems some Heaven-oonstraining

spell.

Iso, one by one thoy pass, and aro no more‚

walking in awful stillness into light

'l’oo pure for mortal wisdom to exploro τ

so solemnly and still they pm from sight 3-

still aa the minuto-watches os the night,

Or trees that by the stream of life appear,

Wniting their change: Ο vision all too bright

For sinful man, who still must walk in sear,

Till death remove the νοῦ, and make the vision clear.

Baptistery‚ p. iv.
