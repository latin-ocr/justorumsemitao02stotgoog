Severus, that he had sometimes seen visions of her
bliss S. Augustius, on the day of her feast, alludes
to the various meanings of her name. “ Blessed is

the holy Agnes,’' says he, “whose passion we this ἵ

day celebrate3 for the maiden was indeed what she
was called: for in Latin Agnes signifies a lamb3 and
in Greek it means pure. She was what she was
called3 and she was found worthy of her erown.”
Prudentius, the great Christian poet of Spain, sings

her love to Christ, and her gentle constancy, in his ,

praises of the martyre: and S. Maximus of Tours, in
the following century, pronounced a beautiful homily
on her feast. She has ever been considered as a
model of virgin grace, second only to the Blessed
Virgin Mother of the Lord. And hence in elder
timeS, when belief more readily than now embodied
itself in deeds, her feast was observed with pecrdiar
honour by the women of England. In the Consti·
tutions of the Synod of Worcester in 1240, there
is an injunction that women shall abstain from all
servile work on the feasts of SS. Agnes, Margaret,
Luoy, and Agatha ⁷. In later and degenerate times,
S. Agnes' day has been a favourite time for divining
future matrimonial fortunes ⁸.

The next no formos earth :-
The palm adorns her hand, the crown her brow ;
She hides the stamp ol her angelio birth,
And men on earth her beauty cannot know ;,
But unto her· ’tis given her God to see,
Making earth heaven, seraphia Chastity.
