Demi· sublone: jon, domeoho lieo,
And form themselves into one holy sold,
'l'o imitate on earth the happy olleo,
With vigil, prayer, ond sacred lii-mles,
Their ooulu lo heavenly contemplation given,
While eorlhly hope within them buried lies,
Their oole employ lo purge the evil leeven,
And render their oleoneed sols a lit obedo lor lleoven.
