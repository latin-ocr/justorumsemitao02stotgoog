for you would account him a papist that would do
it; for such opinion you hold of the ancient monks
and ascetica, as S. Anthony and others, that did prac-
tise it. . . . . You cannot deny this constant reso-
lution oi antiquity. Change therefore your manners

or your minds3 be papists with mc, or rebels with-
out me. If S. chrysostom and his follow-ancienta
be papists, be it so. l am content to be so ac-
counted3 for 1 mean to be apapist with them, rather
thau a noveller with y0u¹.”

So also Thomdike says3 “though the occasions of
the world minister more opportunities of exercising
charity, yet the engagements, which a man that liveth'
in the world bath, make it more difficolt for him.
ln the profession of the monastic life there is ground
sor presuming that those who live in it come nearer
what our baptism professeth‚ by the means thereos,
than others can do.”

Let me cite dre words of Collier who thus writes,
“As to a monastic life, the Church of England has
not declared against it in any of her articles: the
dissolutiones the abbeys in England was an act of
the state and not of the Church ².” And again, “ If
we consider the matter closely all Christiana are
bound to strict living, to discipline, to large distribu-
tions os charity, little less than the monks. They
are false to the engagement os baptism is they man-
age otherwise. The monastic institutions were prin-
cipally designed to revive the piety of the ancient
Christiana, and bring up practice to the rule ol the
Gospel³.''
