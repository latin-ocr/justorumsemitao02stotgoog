court menials‚ whenever he went to Windsor to ask
his dues from the king. But he endured all meelrly

and firmly3 and at the end 01 two years K. Henry
relented, and restored his manois.

No higher praise can the historian of his life give
than when he says that Richard fulfilled every part
01 the Apostolic Rule sor the conduct 01 a bishop.
“A bishop‚” says S. Paul, “ must be blameless‚ as
the steward 01 G0d; not sels-willed, not soon angry,
not given to wine, no striker, not given to lilthy
lucre, but a lover 01 hospitality, a lover 01 good
men, sober, just, holy, temperate ¹.” And if the
discipline 01 the Church allowed him to be the hus-
band 01 000 wife, he who, like the blessed Apostle
himself, served God in the holy celibate, cannot be
said to have fallen short of the llule by exceeding it.
His kindness and pity to the poor and those in
distress endeared him to all. He preached 01100,
“ soothing the contrite, guiding those who came to
confession, reforming the desperate, encouraging the
willing, and strengthening the trembling.'' He prac-
tised severe austerities, and spent a great part of his
time in prayer. Thus did a holy bishop of the
middle ages feed the flock of God‚ and guide their
footstops and his own on the lowly path to heaven.

In 1247 he assisted ot the translation 01 the body
01 S. Edmund, archbishop of Canterbury‚ into the
Cistercian monastery at Pontigny. S. Louis King

1 Blanche 01 Castile‚ and many prelates and nobles of

the kingdom, were present.
