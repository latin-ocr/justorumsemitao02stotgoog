the angel at the Annunciation, and the deeds of her
life, testily. All the honour that we can pay to her
can add nothing to the dignity of the title os reve-
rence by which the whole Church salutes her,-
Motlrer os God. And all redounds to the glory and
exaltation of her Divine Son. If she was preserved
from all stain of sin, it was no less by an aet of His
grace, than if she had been cleansed frorn it as Chris-
tiane ordinarily are. As a daughter of Eve she was
by natiue inclined to sin, if His good Spirit had not
made her perfeotly holy, and preserved her so ¹. y
And is it unreasonable to believe that she was indeed ζ
so miraculously kept from the stain of sin, when we
refleet how carehrlly, if 1 may so say, God provided
for the building of His temple at Jerusalem how
jealous He was lest any thing impure should corne
near it; and how He refused even the holy David,
“the man aller His own heart,” when he would have
assisted, because he was stained with the blood rhed
in just warsl And when it was built, what purifica-
tions and consecrating ceremonies did He command,
in honour of the place where His glory should appear.
But il' l may reverently compare with that temple of
stone the more precious temple of the Lord's body,
where llis Divinity is eternally enshrined, how much
greater purity may He have required in her who was
admitted to be the only fellow·worker with Himsell.
And not finding that purity in her naturally, may He
not have bestowed it upon her by doing that for her
which He does notior any other, because none other
has been adnitted to the same neamess to Himselfl
And those who cannot receive the higher mystery
