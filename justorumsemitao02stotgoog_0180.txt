pallium, reliquary, and girdle were preserved as
precious memoriale. John the Deacon minutely
describes a portrait of him which with those of his
father arrd mother was kept, when he wrote, in the
monastery of S. Andrew. It represents S. Gregory
as of tall and dignified aspect, with a sweet and
noble physiognomy, a beard not very long, and hair
curled and nearly black‚ and wearing the elerical
tonsure. ln his lett hand he held the book of the
Gospels‚ and with his right he gave the blessing.

Of all the eminent persons who before or since his
time have filled the chair of S. Peter, S. Gregory
has left the most voluminous writings. The princi-
pal of these are his Morals or commentaries on the
book of Job, written during his embassy to Constan-

³ tinople3 the Pastoral Care, a treatise on the duties

of a Christian bishop3 the Dialogues, a history of
the life and blessed departure of many holy persons;
twenty-two homilies on the Prophet Ezekiel3 forty
homilies on the Holy Gospels3 and about eight
hundred and forty Epistles

His festival is kept throughout Christendom3 by
the Greeks on the llth March, and on the following
day by the Western Church. In the synodos Clif
or Cloveshove in 747 it was enjoined “that the
natal day of the blessed Pope Gregory, and the day

Ἴ os the Deposition of S. Augustin archbishop and

confessor, who was sent by our father Gregory and
first brought the knowledge of the Faith, the sacra·

ν ment of Baptism, and tidings of the heavenly coun-

try, should be venerated by all with becoming
honour.'' This was confirmed by the counoil of
Oxford in 1222 ¹.
