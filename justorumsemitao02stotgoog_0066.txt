which this day commemoratae, may yet in the feast
of the Conception of the Blessed Virgin‚ celebrate the
joysul dawning of the bright day of mercy, which had
its full consummation in the life of her Divine Son.
A bishop of Nicomedia, writing in the seventh
century, mentions this feast as of ancient date in the
Eastem Church3 but its observance was not enforced
in it till the middle of the twelsth century. lt seems
not to bave become universal in the Westem Churcb
till the fiheenth century. Itis supposed by some to
bave been introduced into Britain by S. Anselm,
Archbishop of Canterbury‚ about the year 1150; but
this is very doubtiirl. It was observed in England
in ancient days with singular devotion. And its
place in the modern kalendar is a proof that it must

¹ have retained a strong hold on the pious affectione of

i the Englisb; for among the many-festivals which

were finally abolished in the seventeenth century,
¹ some of which areos less doubtful origin, it is re·
markable that neither the feast of the Conception nor
of the Nativity of the Blessed Mary was included.

¹ Tbey both stand in the kalendar at this day, silent

witnesses against the cold indifference of modern

’ churchmen to tbe honour of one whom God was

' graciously pleased to honour. “How worthily is
she honoured of men‚'' says bisbop Hall, “whom

3 the angel proclaimed beloved of God! OBlessed
’ Mary! he cannot bless thee, he carmot honour thee
. too much, that deifies thee not. That which the

angel said of thee thou hast prophesied of thyself;
we believe the angel and thee. All generations shall

call thee Blessed, by the Fruit of whose womb all
generations are blessed.”
