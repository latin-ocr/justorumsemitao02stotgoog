night she saw in a vision the Prince of the Apostles
enter her cell, and in the name of his blessed Master
he sured her wounds. This vision is commemorated
in a prefate in the Missal of Milan attributed to S.
Ambrose.

ln four days aster, Agatha was again toruued, and
on being remanded once more to prison, she raised
her hands and eyes towards heaven, and thanked her
Lord for having given her strength to endure every
torment, and for having taken from her all love os
the world, and of this passing life. And she prayed
that, if it might be, He would now take her to Him-
. sels to enjoy His abundant mercy. Her prayer was

heard, and she sweetly fell asleep in the Lord. The
people buried her with great honour. Quintian no
sooner heard of her death than he hastened to confis-
oate her goods. But the anger of Almighty God
followed him, and he was drowned in orossing a river.

‘⁴ Of the love of the heavenly life,'’ says S. Gre-
gory, “Solomon well says, Love is strong as death. . ²
For as death destroys the body, so the desire of eter-
nal life kills the love of earthly things. For not
even that saint whose birth-day we this day cele·
brate could have died in her body for her Lord unless
she had first died in mind to all earthly desires For
her soul being raised up to the height osvinus, de·
spised tortures andeontemned every reward. She
stood before armed kings and govemors‚ stronger
than the striker, higher than the judge. What shall
we, rude and enervated as we are, say when we see
maidens going ‘to the heavenly kingdom through the
sword3 'we wh'om anger overcomes‚ whom pride puffs
up, whom ambition disturbs, and luxury pollutas. κ
