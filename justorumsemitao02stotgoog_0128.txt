and at certain solemn offices, is very ancient, and is

Sparrow ¹, quoting from S. Bemard, ‘⁴ first, to sig-

we do this day especially in memory of 'the wise vir-
gins, of whom the Blessed Virgin is the chief, that
went to meet their Lord with their lamps lit and
hurning: and from this usage, and the many lights
set up in the Church this day, itis called Candlemas
Day: because our works should be all done in the
holy fire of charity3 therefore the candles are lit
with holy fire.”

’ Lighted candles also represent the two natures of
j Christ, by the ¹union of which in one person He is
the true Light of the world. And this seems to be
j the view which is taken of the emblem of lights in '

lights on the high altar before the sacrament, for the
signification that Christ is the very true Light of the
³ world.’' These injunctions are referred to, as of
¹ paramount authority, in dre rubricat the beginning
j of the Book of Common Prayer.

Lights also recal to our recollection thore times
of persecution when the early Christians in Rome
assembled in catacombs by night for the celebration
of the divine mysteries, and when their altar was

osten the tombstone of a martyr. They may also Ι ,

remind us, that the brightest end most joyous of our
