king had become familiar with the northern lan-

Cedd, the elder brother of S. chad, was sent by

the influence of Oswi king of the Northumbrians to
evangelize the East Saxona, about dre year 6533

at Lindisfame, and fixed his see at London. In 660
he founded the monastery of Lestinghen in the pro-

Alcfrid king of the Deiri, to whom his father Oswi
κ had delegated his authority over that province, sent
