3 S. Chad in 1643 is memorable for the death of the
Lord Brook, who commanded the army of the rebel
Puritans. As he led on the attack upon the sacred
enclosure he called aloud on God for a sign by which

’ His approval might be known. While he raised
the visor of his helmet in order to be the better

3 heard, a bullet went through his head and he fell

κ dead on the spot. This fearful sign did not daunt
his fanatical followers3 and they carried the Close
by storm. The treasures of the Church having been

l pillageda century before, by their predecessors in

’ sacrilege, they found nothing to gratify their avarice,

i and were fain to avenge their disappointment on the

l sacred building itself. Soon after the restoration
of King Charles ΙΙ., bishop Hacket repaired ata

great expense the ravages which they had eom·

mitted. ·
“The name of Lichfield is supposed to signify
a field of dead bodies; and the city bears for its
device an escuteheon of landscape with many mar-
tyrs in it, in several ways massacred. A small plot
of ground within the city is still called The Christian

i Field, where a number of Christiana were murdered
by the Romans in 303 or 304, about the same time
as S. Alban’s martyrdom under Maximian the col-
league of Dioclesian. They were lest unburied there
to be devoured by birds and beasts of prey ¹.’'

There were formerly two monasterias in Lichfield;
one called the station of S. Chad‚ afterwards Stow3

Ι and the other under the patronage of the Blessed

l Virgin.
