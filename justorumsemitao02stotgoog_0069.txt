For raya of thy crown are given.

Trns Holyday was so named from two words in the
beginning of the first of the Greatar Antiphone, as
they are called, which are sung at the Mapaiflcat
at vespers, in the churcher of the Roman Obedience.
Their number varies from seven to twelve. The
Roman breviary has seven3 the modern Parisian,
nine; and the old English Church‚ before the reign
of Edward VI., had eight in her office. As the laet
is always sung on the 23rd December, the day on
which they are begun must depend on their number.
Thus the Roman practice is to sing 0 Sapientia on
dre l7th3 the Paneion, on the l5th December. And
the English Church still retains the name in her
kalendar on the 16th December, the day when it was
sung in England in ancient times.

The words of this antiphon are, “0 Sapientia,

qaae ea are Altiaaima' prodiisti, attiapaae a fiae usqae
