escaped. Leofruna abbess of S. Mildred in the Isle
of Thanet was murdered.

The Danes had not been long masters of Canter-
bury before a pestilence attached their army, and
they began to repent of their cruelty, and entreated
the archbishop to assist them. By hie prayersâ€š and
by the distribution among the sich of bread which he
had blessed, the pestilente was removed. Yet their
avarice prevented them from setting the holy man at
liberty till he should pay as his ransom sixty talento,
or about three thousand pounds of silver. He was
carried to Greenwich at the time of Easter, and pay-
ment of this money was publicly demanded from
him. He refused to levy so large asum on the
lands of the chnmh, which are the property of the
poor, and cited the example of the holy deaoon S.
Laurence, who consented to die rather than commit a
similar sacrilege. And be boldly warned his enemies
of the anger of Almighty God which would surely
overtake them if they continued obstinate in their
emelty. They were so enraged that they fell upon
him on the spot, and stoned him to death, and one of
thern, who, as itis related, had not long before been
confirmed by him, finished his life by a stroke of his
battleaxe. As his soul was departing he cried, J esu
receive me in peace and forgive them. This bap-
pened on dre l9th of April 1012, within the Octave
of Easter. Miraculous signs of his acceptance with
God immediately appeared, and so moved the Danes
that they allowed his body to be borne with every

markos honour to the Cathedral church of S. Paul
in London, where it was buried.
