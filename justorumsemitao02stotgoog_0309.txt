The title of Venerable was probably first given to
S. Bede in the ninth nge, out of a peculiar respect,
ee Mobillon proves. The second counoil of Aix
la chapelle, in 886, mentions him, ee “The Vene-
rable, and in modern times, Adrnireble doctor.'’
He was honoured as a Seint and included in foreign
martyrologies before that time. S. Boniiaoe called
him the Lamp of the English Ghurch.

These in lil'e'e dieient even
Shell ehine eerenely bright,

Asin the autumnol heaven
Mild reinbow tinte nt night ;

When the lent shower is steeling down,
And ere they eink to rest,

The eun-beeme weave n parting orown
For eome eweet woodlnnd neet.

The promise ol lhe marrow,
Ie glorioue on thri eve,
Denr ne the holy sorrow
When good men oense ho live.
When brightening ere it die away
Mounte up their alter-lime,
still tending with inteneer roy
To heaven from whenee it orme.

Say not it dies, that glory,
'Tio oeught unquenohed on high,

Thoee eaintlike browe eo hoery
Shnll wear it in the sky.

⁸ No emile is like the smile oi' death,

When all good musinge post

Riee wnited with the parting brenth,
The eweetest thought the leet,

Christian Yeer, p. 289.
