people were 11 essily persuaded iu 1548, immediately 11111
King Edward's secession, 11 lorego ull their 1111111111 saints
end holydays, and to allow the Kalendnr te be reduced 11 the
present red-letter daysi And how did they 11 petiently suffer
this 1111 11111111 year 1519, when the Kalendsr oi King
Edwnrd VI. was restored 11 Queen Msry's decease, till 1601,

, when King Jemes gave them buck their tutelas saints. How

1111 did the conrts 11 justice, and the walres and taire, end the
historiens go 11 11 long without 1 record 11 these holydays in
the Kalendart 'lhe 11111 influence, which 1115191111 11111-
eiled those who had seen the ancient observsnee 11 them, to
their total suppression, might surely after the lapse 11 nearly
11111 a century, 11111 1111 1111111111 their children and grand
children in 1601, who hsd never 1111 the ancient observares,
to 1111 contentedly without 1 record 11 the 111111 1111111 et

l least tc keep their memorics slive iu their own way, without

being grievonsly “displessed il their 111111111 scint's 11111

were left 11111 the Kalendar.” Had 1 monarch such as King
, Edward VI. filled the throne instead ol King dames I., or

3 King Chsrles ΙΙ, “the 1111111111 which were writ beiore the
Reformation'' must have remained 1111111 books till this day,

11111· 11 least 11 the Keleudnr 11 the Ρ11111-Β1111 could have
given 111 assistance. And the 111111 11 justice must have
suffered 111111111111 all record ot their “days oi return.”
For it is evident that the people, the lawyers, end the de·

, cipher-ers 11 dates hsd much less influence 11 the iraming 11

the Kalendar than the king and the 11111111111, 11 else they

would 111 11 silently have borne the act 11 the sovereign end

1111 elergy which deprived them 11 it. ’
Again, Mr. Wheetley's theory does not explain the titles 11

’ distinction and respect which were sdded to the nomes 11

the saints in 1662, which were not added in 1604. 'Phe nativity

historical purposes under the title 11 Nativity os Moffy (1604)
