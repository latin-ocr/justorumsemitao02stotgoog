Christian children who had been condemned to that
cruel death by the Pagans.

S. Nicolas has ever been considered the patron ol
children. The reason of this is given in simple lan·
guagc in the Boolt os Fertiaolr: ‘⁴ It is said that his
foder hyght Epiphanius, and his moder J oanua, when
he was born, made him Christen‚ and called him
Nycolas, that is a manne’s name; buthe kepeth the
name of a child, for he chose to kepe vertues, meke-
nes‚ and simplenes‚ and without malice. Thus he
lyved all his lyfe in vertues with hia childe's name.
And therefore children do him worship before all
other saints.’'

¹ Hence arose the ancient custom‚ among ¹the chil-

dren of cathedral aud collegiate churches and schools,
of celebrating his feast with many curious ceremonies.
On S. Nicolas’ day one of the choristers was an·
uually chosen by his companions to preside over
them, with the name and dignity of a bishop; aud
his office lasted till the Feast of the Innocents. He
was arrayed in 'the pontifical vestments‚ and could
p sing any part of the Divino Office except the

l Mass. 011 the Feast of the Innocents there wasa

grand procession, in which the usual order was re-
versed, and the canons of the church performed the
duties of the children, while the choristers and their
child-bishop had the place of dignity assigned to
them The reason of this is given in a sermon deli-

vered by a boy-hishop iu Gloucester cathedral. His

text was S. Matth. xviii. 3. “Thus much have I

said of the virtue of innocency for the honour of

those blessed Innocents who are remembered in the

Church this day; which day, as it is commonly
