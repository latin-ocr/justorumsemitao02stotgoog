Such was the unvarying teaching and practice
of the Chureh from Apostolic times3 none who
professed to draw their hopes from the death of
Christ refused their humble homage to the Sign of
their Redemption. Their devotion to the Cross
may be expressed in the words of the blessed abbat
of clamauit, “Crux in corde, corin Cruce’'-their
heart in the Cross, and the Cross in their heart. It
was reserved for later ages of the world to behold
men, who pretended to have discovered no new way
of salvation, openly insult the blessed sign of the
Cross which their Catholic fathers had ever revered‚
because upon it the Sacrifice of our Redemption had
been consummated. The bitterest revilers of the
Holy Cross are not, as formerly, the pagens and the
Jews, but men who bear the sacred name of Chris-
tian. “ Itis not an open enemy‚” says the Lord in
the Book of Psalms, “that hath done Me this dis-
honour: for then l could have borne it; neither was
it Mine adversary, that did magnify himself against
Me 3 for then peradventure I would have hid Myself
from him¹.” In the eyes of these men, to use the
language of the author of the essay formerly quoted,
“the Cross on which Christ suffered is but a piece
of wood3 and, as they sometimes speak both of it
and of the sign of it, it is something loathsome and
hatefirh bringing our Lord under the curse rather
than sanctified by Him ².'’

That there are some great authorities among the
modern doctors of the English Church who sanction
the pious reverence of antiquity for the Crosa, let the
following quotations show. ‘⁶ To condemn the whole
