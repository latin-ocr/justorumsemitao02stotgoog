For ever hallowed be this morning fair,

Blest be the unconscious shore on which ye tr'ead,
And blest the silver Crass, which ye, instead

Oi martial banner, in processioa bear ;

'l'he Crosa preceding Him who lloats in air,

The pictur-ed Susiana-By Augustin led,

'l'hey come-sud onward travel without dread,
Chaunting in herbernus ears a tunelul prayer-
Sung lor themselves, and those whom they would free.
Rich conquest waits them ;—the tempestuous ses
of ignorasse, that ran so rough and high,

And hesdcd nottho voice ol clashiug swords,

These good men humble by slew bare words,
And calm with sear of God’s divinity.

Tuas illustrious doctor of the Church was born near
the village of Jarrow, in the ancient kingdom of
Northumbria, about the year 673. When he was
seven years of age he was sent by his relations to the
monastery of S. Peter at Weremouth. S. Benedict
Biscop, who was then abbat, had founded it in 674,
with the assistance of K. ngrid. Not far from it

was the monastery of J arrow, near the mouth of the
river Tyne‚ which the same holy abbat had dedicated
in hohour of S. Paul, in the year 684. These houses
were then govemed by one superior. They aster-
wsrds became cells to the abbey of Durham.
