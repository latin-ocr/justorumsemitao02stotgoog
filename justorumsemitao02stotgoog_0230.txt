S. Arcanos was born of a noble family in Britain
about the year 954. While he was still very young
he renounced the world, and notwithstanding the tears
and entreaties of his mother retired into the monastery
of Dersherste in the connty of· Gloucester. Alter a
time he became abbatos the religious house at Bath.
The discipline had been very much relaxed before
his coming, and the irregularities of the monks gave
great offence. His efforts to restore order were un·
ceasing3 and at last the sudden death of one of the
most irregular alarmed the consciences of the rest,-
and they all submitted to the govemment of the
salnt.

On the death of Ethelwold, bishop of winchester,
in 984, disputes arose between the monks and seculars
regarding his successor. S. Dunstan, who was then
primate of England, was directed, as some historiens
say, by S. Andrew to appoint the holy abbat of Bath
to the vacant see. He carried with him the ans-
terities ol the monastery into the episcopal palace,
and was a pattem of sanctity and sels-discipline. His
chief care was for the poor of his diocess, and he
pleaded their cause so irresistibly both by words and
by example, that it was said there was not a beggar

, in the whole of his diocess during his episcopata.

‘⁶ Behold the Jew and the Pagan!” he would cry3

“ observe how they are bound together in the ties of
their religion3 see how none of thern are oppressed
