his ordination. In the English Church it seems
always to have been observed on the 4th April, the
anniversary of his blessed departure. He is gene·

Latin Church‚ with lerum, Augustin‚ and Gregory
the Great. It is doubtful whether the Ambrosiun
Rite et Milan was compiled by him, or whether it
wes named in honour of him when it was first used

To thee un eye to trece out the third heaven
In holy urit, oud see the mercy-throne,—
A brother's love,-o poet's lyre was given,
But yet o’er nll thy gille the Pastor shone,
'l'o God'e high eltru- bound, no more thine own.

While Theodosius to thy stern deeree
Folle down, end owns the lreys end power divine 3

For kings thet fain her nursing eires would he
To the Eternel Bride must bend the knoe.

1 see thee throned upon the Teacher’e seat,-
And 'mid the crowd e silent wonder-er steel ;
Iu his sed breoet, while sitting et thy leet
The Fether doth the Etennal Son reveel,
And Austin lrom thy hande receives the Spirit’e seul.
